Prosthetic knees range from simple, purely mechanical devices to sophisticated microprocessor-controlled systems. A Hydraulic prosthetic knee consists of a hydraulic cylinder in a single axis or polycentric knee design. Valves of the hydraulic cylinder can be adjusted to tune the swing flexion and extension as per the amputee's desired walking speed.
