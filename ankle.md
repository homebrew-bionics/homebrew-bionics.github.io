A prosthetic ankle can either be a passive SACH *(Solid Ankle Cushioned Heel)* feet or an active ESAR *(Energy Storage and Return)* feet. A ESAR feet is capable of storing energy during the stance phase and releasing it during push-off. Though ESAR feet can better mimic the functions of an actual ankle, a SACH feet is lighter, durable, more stable and is quite inexpensive.
